"use server";
// That's a Server Functions Module.

// ...Importing a Server Functions Module.
import serverFunctions from "../../../../../imported/javascript/server-functions.js";

// Valid.
// Server Functions, even though they don't need to import one another and the same results can be generated via Server Logics for the outcome of a single Server Function, can still compose with one another. (Perhaps a preferrable use case for this has been found or could be found either today or in the future.)
