"use server";
// That's a Server Functions Module.

// ...Importing a Server Functions Module (with extension).
import serverFunctions from "../../../../../imported/typescript/server-functions.ts";
// Via alias.
import serverFunctionsAlias from "@/tests/agnostic20/imported/typescript/server-functions.ts";
// Via baseUrl.
import serverFunctionsBaseUrl from "tests/agnostic20/imported/typescript/server-functions.ts";

// ...Importing a Server Functions Module by a folder.
import serverFunctionsFolder from "../../../../../imported/typescript/server-functions-ts";
// Via alias.
import serverFunctionsFolderAlias from "@/tests/agnostic20/imported/typescript/server-functions-ts";
// Via baseUrl.
import serverFunctionsFolderBaseUrl from "tests/agnostic20/imported/typescript/server-functions-ts";

// Valid.
// Server Functions, even though they don't need to import one another and the same results can be generated via Server Logics for the outcome of a single Server Function, can still compose with one another. (Perhaps a preferrable use case for this has been found or could be found either today or in the future.)
