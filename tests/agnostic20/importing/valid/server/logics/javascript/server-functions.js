// That's a Server Logics Module.

// ...Importing a Server Functions Module (with extension).
import serverFunctions from "../../../../../imported/javascript/server-functions.js";

// ...Importing a Server Functions Module by a folder.
import serverFunctionsFolder from "../../../../../imported/javascript/server-functions-js";

// Valid.
// Server Functions, being able to import one another, can compose and do so via Server Logics, despite this method seeming superfluous at first glance. (Perhaps a preferrable use case for this has been found or could be found either today or in the future.)
