// Valid.
// (Special) Client Contexts Components can effectively become Lineal and only render their children on the client via this mechanism since, by a Client Contexts Component being the child of a Lineal Client Component, the Client Contexts Component's children become the grandchildren of an ancestor Lineal Client Component, enforcing them to render exclusively on the client.
