// "use server functions"

// ...Importing a Special Server Functions Module.
import serverFunctions from "../../../../../imported/javascript/server-functions.js";

// ...Importing a Special Server Functions Module by a folder.
import serverFunctionsFolder from "../../../../../imported/javascript/server-functions-js";

// ...Importing (Special) Server Functions via Special Agnostic Strategy.
import {
  /* @serverFunctions */ serverFunctionsStrategized,
} from "../../../../../imported/javascript/agnostic-strategies.jsx";

// ...Importing (Special) Server Functions via Special Agnostic Strategy by a folder.
import {
  /* @serverFunctions */ serverFunctionsStrategizedFolder,
} from "../../../../../imported/javascript/agnostic-strategies-jsx";

// Valid.
// (Special) Server Functions, even though they don't need to import one another and the same results can be generated via Prime Server Logics for the outcome of a single Server Function, can still compose with one another. (Perhaps a preferrable use case for this has been found or could be found either today or in the future.)
