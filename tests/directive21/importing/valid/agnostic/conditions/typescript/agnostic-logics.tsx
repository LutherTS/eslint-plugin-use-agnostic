import {

// Valid.
// Prime Agnostic Logics, being environment-agnostic logic, can safely support Agnostic Components, including (Special) Agnostic Conditions Components. (In this case this is necessary for the import of the `conditionAgnosticComponent` function needed to make Agnostic Conditions Components.)
